5. Demonstrate loop termination conditions

- set up an MTEX environment locally
- demonstrate how to submit a subset of tasks
- demonstrate how to continue a workflow on another machine
- demonstrate aborting a run (sequence with a small and v. large grid size) 
  - show task schema where abortability is specified
- demo-workflow CLI and API
- may need to set up config on csf3?
- loops with terminations criterion?
- run fit yield function workflow - show structure is different (using input sources now) - then zip, download, unzip, add another element set to fit to another yield point?
